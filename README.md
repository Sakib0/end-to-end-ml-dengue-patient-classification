# ðŸ©º Dengue Patient Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting dengue infection using patient demographic and diagnostic information such as **Gender, Age, Area Type, House Type, NS1, IgG, and IgM** test results.  
The objective is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection of dengue and provide insights for public health decision-making â€” especially relevant in **Bangladesh**, where dengue cases are a major concern.

##  Project Overview
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that can become life-threatening if not detected early.  
This project applies **machine learning classification models** to predict the likelihood of dengue based on simple and widely available health indicators.

## How to run the project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sakib0/end-to-end-ml-dengue-patient-classification.git
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
    Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
